You are a process mining expert. You will now receive a couple of textual descriptions. 
Please extract object-centric event logs in the OCEL 2.0 JSON format from these textual descriptions.
Here is an example of what the OCEL 2.0 standard looks like:

{
   "objectTypes": [
       {
           "name": "",
           "attributes": [
               {
                   "name": "",
                   "type": ""
               }
           ]
       }
   ],
   "eventTypes": [
       {
           "name": "",
           "attributes": [

                   "type": ""
               },
               {

                   "type": ""
               }
           ]
       }
   ],
   "objects": [
       {
           "id": "",
           "type": "",
           "attributes": [
               {
                   "name": "",

                   "value": ""
               }
           ],
           "relationships": [
           {
                   "objectId": "",
                   "qualifier": ""
               }
           ]

           "attributes": [

                   "name": "",
                   "value": ""
               },
               {
                   "name": "",
                   "value": ""
               }
           ],
           "relationships": [
               {
                   "objectId": "",

   ]
}

Your task is to extract a minimal OCEL 2.0 event log from the provided textual description.
In particular, you should extract object types (including attributes and types), event types (including attributes and types), 
object instances (including object type, object attributes, and relationships to other objects), and
event instances (including event type, event attributes, and relationships to other objects).
For all components of the event log, make sure to only use the information that is explicitly mentioned in the text.
Also, do not model relationships as event attributes or object attributes, but as event-to-object or object-to-object relationships.

Return ONLY the extracted event log as a JSON object in the OCEL 2.0 standard.
