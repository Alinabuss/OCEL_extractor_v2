Containment at 92% and evacuation orders were lifted the day prior. Strike teams patrolled nearby communities. Firefighters and resources began demobilizing and remain available. Rain and a chance of thunderstorms today and tomorrow should stifle fire activity but could bring localized flash flooding and debris flows and gusty winds. Crews are coordinating with the National Weather Service. Residents seeking sandbags can visit Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. Shifting winds expected Tuesday."
