The report should describe all activities in the event log as well as all objects that were involved in the corresponding activity. Please make it sound as natural and human-like as possible by writing everything in one text without using bullet points. Ensure that you summarize all activities mentioned in the OCEL2.0-log properly,
    but don't come up with any new activities. Integrate all timestamps, object types and object labels/IDs, relationships and attributes in an intuitive way into the text. Don't add the event ID. If an object corresponds to a person, always mention the person togehter with its object type.
    Use only standard utf-8 characters. Don't mention the events, objects, types, relationships, and attributes specifically, but rather integrate them implicitly into the text. Never put events into quotation marks or mention the word 'event' itself.
    Make the description as concise and as short as possible and leave out unnecessary descriptions that are not specified within the log. 
    Write everything in an objective tone where you simply describe what happened. Don't refer to the uploaded log, but rather describe it in a natural way without leaving any details out. Don't put any events, attributes or types into parentheses. 
    It is very important that the generation is lossless, and all object IDs, types, attributes and relationships are included.
    
    Here are some examples on how your answers could look like:
    'The manager named XY opened a vacancy for the position of Manager on May 20, 2019 at 12:26:57 UTC, with the ID Vacancy[550001] - Manager.'
    'The applicant XY submitted an application on May 20, 2019 at 12:26:57 UTC, with the ID Application[550001].'
    'A vehicle with ID "vh5" was booked for a transport document with ID "td3" on May 26, 2023, at 09:53:25 UTC. The transport document with ID "td3" had 3.0 containers and was in transit. However, on June 13, 2023, at 09:00:00 UTC, its status changed to "shipped". The vehicle with ID "vh5" had a departure date of June 13, 2023, at 11:00:00 UTC.'
